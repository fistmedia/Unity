Some scripts for the game and one of original Mobile Forces maps (Western) ported to Unity.

SabreCSG used to import some geometry of the map (bsp brushes is how they called I suppose). The tool can be downloaded here: https://github.com/sabresaurus/SabreCSG.

Scene file is zipped because file size too big for GitHub. You might want to unzip it in order to open the map in Unity.

To install everything you might want to put everything in Unity project/Assets directory together with SabreCSG, open the project folder in Unity, open scene file.
